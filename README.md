# North East subset of the Bus Open Data Service

This code is in the very early stages of development. Its purpose is to subset the Department for Transport's Bus Open Data Service offering with just operators that run services in North East England, for use in HowBusyIsToon and Urban Observatory projects.

The SIRI-VM data is presented as a single JSON API after conversion from XML. The API offers no functionality beyond a complete list at present.
